Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
What’s up with the greed Joe?
Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
Hi!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Wow!
After one class? I don’t think so.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call unagi.
No, it’s a concept!
All right, maybe it means that too…
Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a surprise!!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.
Y’know what…
No.
So what are you gonna do?
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Unagi. I’m always aware.
What’s up?
Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Why not?
Oh.
It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
It’s a great class.
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Yes that’s right.
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
DANGER!!!!
