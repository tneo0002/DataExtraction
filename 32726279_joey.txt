Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!
All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Yeah?
Uhh do it?
Well, where was I?
Takes it out of you?
Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
And of course, crotchless panties.
You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…
Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.
Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
But it’s $2,000.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is…
Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?
Damnit Carl!
That’s us.
That’s right, $2,000.
Damnit Carl!
