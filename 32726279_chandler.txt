Yeah.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
I see where you’re goin’!
Ah, finally an explanation.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
I made a…
Nothing!
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
This, this actually is a…
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
What?
Hey.
What?!
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can’t do it. I can’t do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Okay, come here! Come here.
Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
Okay!
Yeah!
It’s a sock bunny.
Not really.
I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Yeah!
You have done enough!
No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.
Oop!
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?
Oh my good God.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Oh, the mixed tape.
No! You’re the sweetest!
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Okay.
So, are we going in there?
